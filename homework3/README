syn_graph.txt contains a synthetic graph. The format is as following:

  - the first line (line 0) contains the number of nodes (= 100)
  - Line1-100: each line i contains the neighbors of node i-1 (node index starts from 0)
    E.g., in line 1: 
      2 3 4 5 ...
    means the graph contains (directed) links: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), ...
